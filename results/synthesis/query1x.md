## Script Variables
- model:<br>
>The variable model is a logistic regression model that is trained on the training data. The model is used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is trained using the training data and the training labels. The model is then used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels. The model is evaluated using the test labels and the test accuracy is calculated. The model is then used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels
- x_test:<br>
>x_test is a numpy array of shape (10000, 784) containing the test data.
- y_hat:<br>
>The variable y_hat is the predicted probability of the target variable (y) given the input features (x). It is a 2D array with the same shape as the input data (x_test). The first dimension represents the number of samples and the second dimension represents the number of classes. The value of each element in the array is a probability between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood that the corresponding sample belongs to the corresponding class. The model uses the input data (x_test) to calculate the predicted probabilities (y_hat) and then returns them as
- signal:<br>
>It is a function that takes a graph and a group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input
- algorithm:<br>
>The variable algorithm is a Python script that calculates the heat kernel for a given kernel. The heat kernel is a mathematical function that describes the rate of change of a function with respect to time. In this case, the heat kernel is used to calculate the rate of change of the function with respect to the kernel. The variable algorithm is used to calculate the heat kernel for a given kernel, and is used in many applications such as image processing, signal processing, and machine learning.
- hk:<br>
>It is a variable that stores the rank of the highest scoring model in the training data. This variable is used to determine the best model to use for prediction.
- print:<br>
>The variable print is a function that prints the output of the measure function, which is the rank of the train data set. The measure function is used to calculate the rank of the data set based on the given criteria. The rank is then used to determine the best model for the data set.
- measure:<br>
>Measure is a variable that is used to rank the importance of each feature in a dataset. It is a measure of the predictive power of each feature in a dataset. It is used to rank the features based on their importance in predicting the target variable. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the variance of the feature to the variance of the target variable. The higher the value of the measure, the more important the feature is in predicting the target variable. It is used in machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to select the best features
- train:<br>
>It is a list of tuples, each tuple contains a pair of (word, score) where score is the probability of the word being a positive review.
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array of size (n_samples, n_features) containing the training data. The values of x_train are the features of the training data. The values of y_train are the labels of the training data.
- LogisticRegression:<br>
>LogisticRegression is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification problems. It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a logistic function to map the input data to the output data. The logistic function is a sigmoid function that maps the input data to the probability of the output data. The output data is a binary value (0 or 1) that indicates whether the input data belongs to the positive or negative class. The logistic regression algorithm uses a set of weights and biases to map the input data to the output data. The weights and biases are learned from the training data using
- y_train:<br>
>It is a list of integers that represents the labels of the training data.
