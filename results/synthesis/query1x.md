## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: flatten the images
```python
n_samples = len(digits.images)
data = digits.images.reshape((n_samples, -1))
```

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_compare_cross_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT:  PLS regression, with univariate response, a.k.a. PLS1   COMMENT:
```python
print("Estimated betas")
print(np.round(pls1.coef_, 1))
```

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_compare_cross_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT:  PLS regression, with multivariate response, a.k.a. PLS2   COMMENT:
```python
Y = np.dot(X, B) + np.random.normal(size=n * q).reshape((n, q)) + 5
pls2 = PLSRegression(n_components=3)
pls2.fit(X, Y)
print("True B (such that: Y = XB + Err)")
print(B)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_classification_probability.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Probabilistic classifiers  We will plot the decision boundaries of several classifiers that have a `predict_proba` method. This will allow
us to visualize the uncertainty of the classifier in regions where it is not certain of its prediction.   COMMENT:
```python
classifiers = {
    "Logistic regression\n(C=0.01)": LogisticRegression(C=0.1),
    "Logistic regression\n(C=1)": LogisticRegression(C=100),
    "Gaussian Process": GaussianProcessClassifier(kernel=1.0 * RBF([1.0, 1.0])),
    "Logistic regression\n(RBF features)": make_pipeline(
        Nystroem(kernel="rbf", gamma=5e-1, n_components=50, random_state=1),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
    "Gradient Boosting": HistGradientBoostingClassifier(),
    "Logistic regression\n(binned features)": make_pipeline(
        KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=5, quantile_method="averaged_inverted_cdf"),
        PolynomialFeatures(interaction_only=True),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
    "Logistic regression\n(spline features)": make_pipeline(
        SplineTransformer(n_knots=5),
        PolynomialFeatures(interaction_only=True),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
