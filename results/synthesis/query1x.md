## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: Predict the value of the digit on the test subset
```python
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```

### notebooks/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT: If the results from evaluating a classifier are stored in the form of a `confusion matrix <confusion_matrix>` and not in terms of `y_true`
and `y_pred`, one can still build a :func:`~sklearn.metrics.classification_report` as follows:   COMMENT: For each cell in the confusion matrix, add
the corresponding ground truths and predictions to the lists
```python
for gt in range(len(cm)):
    for pred in range(len(cm)):
        y_true += [gt] * cm[gt][pred]
        y_pred += [pred] * cm[gt][pred]
print(
    "Classification report rebuilt from confusion matrix:\n"
    f"{metrics.classification_report(y_true, y_pred)}\n"
)
```

### notebooks/plot_classification_probability.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Probabilistic classifiers  We will plot the decision boundaries of several classifiers that have a `predict_proba` method. This will allow
us to visualize the uncertainty of the classifier in regions where it is not certain of its prediction.   COMMENT:
```python
classifiers = {
    "Logistic regression\n(C=0.01)": LogisticRegression(C=0.1),
    "Logistic regression\n(C=1)": LogisticRegression(C=100),
    "Gaussian Process": GaussianProcessClassifier(kernel=1.0 * RBF([1.0, 1.0])),
    "Logistic regression\n(RBF features)": make_pipeline(
        Nystroem(kernel="rbf", gamma=5e-1, n_components=50, random_state=1),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
    "Gradient Boosting": HistGradientBoostingClassifier(),
    "Logistic regression\n(binned features)": make_pipeline(
        KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=5, quantile_method="averaged_inverted_cdf"),
        PolynomialFeatures(interaction_only=True),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
    "Logistic regression\n(spline features)": make_pipeline(
        SplineTransformer(n_knots=5),
        PolynomialFeatures(interaction_only=True),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
}
```

### notebooks/plot_classifier_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Classifier comparison  A comparison of several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic datasets. The point of this example is to
illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by these
examples does not necessarily carry over to real datasets.  Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be separated linearly and
the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes and linear SVMs might lead to better generalization than is achieved by other classifiers.  The
plots show training points in solid colors and testing points semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test set.
COMMENT: iterate over classifiers
```python
for name, clf in zip(names, classifiers):
    ax = plt.subplot(len(datasets), len(classifiers) + 1, i)
    clf = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), clf)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    score = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(
        clf, X, cmap=cm, alpha=0.8, ax=ax, eps=0.5
    )
```
