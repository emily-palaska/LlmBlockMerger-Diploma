## Script Variables
- pg:<br>
>The variable pg is used to store the PageRank values of each node in the graph. It is a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are the PageRank values. The PageRank algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each node in the graph based on the links between them. The alpha parameter is used to control the damping factor of the algorithm, which determines how much weight is given to the links between nodes. The PageRank values are then used to rank the nodes in the graph based on their importance.
- graph:<br>
>The graph variable is a networkx graph object. It is used to represent the network of nodes and edges in the dataset. The nodes represent the individuals in the dataset, and the edges represent the connections between them. The graph is used to perform various network analysis tasks, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, or identifying the most important nodes in the network.
- model:<br>
>The model is a machine learning model that is used to train a model on the given data. The model takes in the input data and the target data and uses this information to learn a function that maps the input data to the target data. The model is then used to make predictions on new data.
- LogisticRegression:<br>
>LogisticRegression is a classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a given data point belonging to a particular class. It is based on the logistic function, which is a sigmoid function that maps the input data to a probability value between 0 and 1. The output of the logistic function is then used to predict the class of the data point.
- ppr:<br>
>ppr is a function that takes a training set as input and returns a list of the top 10 most important features in the training set. The function uses a ranking algorithm called "PageRank" to determine the importance of each feature.
- measure:<br>
>AUC is a measure of the quality of a binary classifier or a ranker. It is defined as the area under the ROC curve. AUC is a measure of the quality of a binary classifier or a ranker. It is defined as the area under the ROC curve. AUC is a measure of the quality of a binary classifier or a ranker. It is defined as the area under the ROC curve. AUC is a measure of the quality of a binary classifier or a ranker. It is defined as the area under the ROC curve. AUC is a measure of
- print:<br>
>It is a function that is used to print the value of the variable measure(hk.rank(train)).
- train:<br>
>It is a variable that is used to calculate the area under the curve of the ROC curve. The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different thresholds for the classifier. The AUC is a measure of the area under the ROC curve, and it is used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. The train variable is used to calculate the AUC for the test data, which is the data that is used to evaluate the performance of the classifier. The AUC is a measure of the classifier's ability to
- hk:<br>
>The variable hk is used to calculate the heat kernel for the given data. It is a function that takes in the data and returns the heat kernel.
- x_test:<br>
>It is a numpy array of shape (1000, 784) containing the test images.
- y_hat:<br>
>It is a variable that is used to store the predicted values of the model. It is a numpy array with the same shape as the input data (x_test). The variable is created using the predict() method of the model object, which takes the input data as an argument and returns the predicted values. The variable is created with the keyword argument probs=True, which indicates that the model should return the predicted probabilities instead of the predicted classes. This is useful when the model is trained with a classification task, but the predicted values are needed for other purposes, such as calculating the
- y_train:<br>
>It is a variable that represents the training data. It is a 2D array of size (n,1) where n is the number of training samples. The value of each element in the array is either 0 or 1, representing the class label of the corresponding sample. The variable y_train is used to train the logistic regression model.
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array containing the training data. The data is normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done to ensure that the data is comparable across different datasets and models. The normalization process is also known as standardization or z-score normalization.
