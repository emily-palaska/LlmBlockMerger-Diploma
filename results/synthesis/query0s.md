Query: `Initialize a logistic regression model. Use standardization on training inputs. Train the model.`
## Variables:
- model:<br>
>The model is a machine learning model that is used to train a model on the given data. The model takes in the input data and the target data and uses this information to learn a function that maps the input data to the target data. The model is then used to make predictions on new data.
- LogisticRegression:<br>
>LogisticRegression is a classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a given data point belonging to a particular class. It is based on the logistic function, which is a sigmoid function that maps the input data to a probability value between 0 and 1. The output of the logistic function is then used to predict the class of the data point.
- y_train:<br>
>It is a variable that represents the training data. It is a 2D array of size (n,1) where n is the number of training samples. The value of each element in the array is either 0 or 1, representing the class label of the corresponding sample. The variable y_train is used to train the logistic regression model.
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array containing the training data. The data is normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done to ensure that the data is comparable across different datasets and models. The normalization process is also known as standardization or z-score normalization.
