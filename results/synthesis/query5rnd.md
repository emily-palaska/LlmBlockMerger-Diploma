CONTEXT:  Plotting the decision boundaries  For each classifier, we plot the per-class probabilities on the first three columns and the probabilities
of the most likely class on the last column.   COMMENT:
```python
n_classifiers = len(classifiers)
scatter_kwargs = {
    "s": 25,
    "marker": "o",
    "linewidths": 0.8,
    "edgecolor": "k",
    "alpha": 0.7,
}
y_unique = np.unique(y)
```
