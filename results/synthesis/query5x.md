## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_compare_cross_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Scatter plot of scores   COMMENT: Off diagonal plot components 1 vs 2 for X and Y
```python
from sklearn.cross_decomposition import PLSRegression
n = 1000
q = 3
p = 10
X = np.random.normal(size=n * p).reshape((n, p))
B = np.array([[1, 2] + [0] * (p - 2)] * q).T
```

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT: For the purpose of this example, we now define the target `y` such that it is strongly correlated with a direction that has a small variance.
To this end, we will project `X` onto the second component, and add some noise to it.   COMMENT:
```python
pca = pcr.named_steps["pca"]
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: Predict the value of the digit on the test subset
```python
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
from sklearn.cross_decomposition import PLSRegression
n = 1000
q = 3
p = 10
X = np.random.normal(size=n * p).reshape((n, p))
B = np.array([[1, 2] + [0] * (p - 2)] * q).T
pca = pcr.named_steps["pca"]
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```
