## Script Variables
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative.
- G:<br>
>The variable G is a graph object that represents the network of interactions between the nodes in the system. It contains information about the edges between the nodes, such as the weight of each edge, the direction of the edge, and any additional properties associated with the edge. The variable G is used to calculate the rank of each node in the network, which is a measure of the importance of each
- msq:<br>
>It is a measure of the distance between the ranks of the nodes in the graph and the ranks of the nodes in the previous iteration. It is used to determine when the algorithm has converged to a stable solution.
- len:<br>
>len is a function that returns the length of a sequence. In this case, it is the number of nodes in the graph G. It is used to calculate the mean square error (msq) which is used to determine when the algorithm has converged.
- sum:<br>
>The variable sum is used to calculate the normalized prior ranks. It is the sum of all the prior ranks in the dictionary p. The normalized prior ranks are used to rank the nodes in the graph according to their prior probabilities.
- u:<br>
>u is a variable that stores the degree of each node in the graph G. It is calculated by taking the square root of the number of neighbors for each node in the graph. This is done to make the values more manageable and easier to work with in the script. The script uses the built-in function len() to count the number of neighbors for each node and then takes the square root of the result to get the degree of each node. This is done for both the original graph G and the graph G with the degree of each node
- degv:<br>
>degv is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative.
- prior_ranks:<br>
>Prior ranks are the ranks of the nodes in the graph prior to the iteration. They are used to calculate the new ranks of the nodes in the graph. The prior ranks are used to calculate the new ranks of the nodes in the graph. The prior ranks are used to calculate the new ranks of the nodes in the graph. The prior ranks are used to calculate the new
- v:<br>
>v is a variable that is used to store the degree of a node in the graph.
- a:<br>
>a is a constant that is used to control the rate of change of the ranks. It is used to control the rate of change of the ranks. It is used to control the rate of change of the ranks. It is used to control the rate of change of the ranks. It is used to control the rate of change of the ranks. It is used to control the rate of change of the ranks
- msq_error:<br>
>It is a measure of the error in the ranking of nodes in the graph. It is used to determine when the algorithm has converged to a stable ranking. The algorithm stops when the error is less than a certain threshold.
- next_ranks:<br>
>It is a dictionary that stores the rank of each node in the graph. It is initialized with the ranks of the nodes in the previous iteration. The ranks are updated based on the formula provided in the script. The ranks are then normalized to ensure that they sum to 1. The script continues to run until the change in ranks is less than a certain threshold, indicating
- ranks:<br>
>The variable ranks is a list of integers that represent the ranks of the nodes in the graph. The ranks are initialized with the prior ranks and are updated using the Louvain algorithm. The Louvain algorithm is a community detection algorithm that iteratively assigns nodes to communities based on their similarity to other nodes in the community. The ranks are used to calculate the similarity between nodes, which is
- rank:<br>
>It is a dictionary that stores the rank of each node in the graph. The rank is calculated as the sum of the ranks of the neighbors of a node divided by the degree of the node. The rank is then multiplied by a constant a and the previous rank of the node is added to get the new rank. This process is repeated until the change in rank is small enough.
- pg:<br>
>pg is a variable that is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The dataset is split into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split() function is used to split the dataset into two sets, and the pg variable is used to store the result of the split() function.
- algorithm:<br>
>The variable algorithm is a Python script that calculates the heat kernel for a given kernel. The heat kernel is a mathematical function that describes the rate of change of a function with respect to time. In this case, the heat kernel is used to calculate the rate of change of the function with respect to the kernel. The variable algorithm is used to calculate the heat kernel for a given kernel, and is used in many applications such as image processing, signal processing, and machine learning.
- alpha:<br>
>Alpha is a variable that is used to represent the learning rate of the neural network. It is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how quickly the neural network learns from the data. A higher value of alpha means that the neural network will learn faster, but it may also be more prone to overfitting. A lower value of alpha means that the neural network will learn slower, but it may also be less prone to overfitting. The optimal value of alpha depends on the specific problem being solved and the type of neural network being used.
- graph:<br>
>The variable graph is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a node in the graph and contains the node's ID and its neighbors. The neighbors are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the ID of the neighbor and the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes.
- group:<br>
>The variable group is a list of two variables, the first one is a list of nodes and the second one is a list of edges. The nodes are represented as strings and the edges are represented as tuples of two strings. The variable group is used to represent the graph structure of the dataset.
- loaded:<br>
>loaded is a variable that is loaded from a dataset. It is a list of two elements, the first element is a bigraph object and the second element is a group object. The bigraph object contains information about the network, such as the number of nodes and edges, while the group object contains information about the community structure, such as the number of communities and the membership of each node in a community.
