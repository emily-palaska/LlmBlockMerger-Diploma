- json:<br>
>The variable json is a dictionary that contains two keys, 'nodes' and 'links'. The 'nodes' key contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a node in the graph. Each node dictionary has an 'id' key that corresponds to the node's unique identifier, and a 'color_intensity' key that represents the node's color intensity.
- outfile:<br>
>outfile is a variable that is used to store the data in a json file. The data is stored in a dictionary called data. The data dictionary has two keys, nodes and links. The nodes key contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a node in the graph. Each dictionary has an id key, which is the unique identifier for the node,
- node2:<br>
>Node2 is a variable that is used to represent the nodes in the graph. It is a dictionary that contains the id of each node and its color intensity. The color intensity is calculated based on the normalized prior ranks of each node. This variable is used to visualize the graph using d3.js library.
- G:<br>
>G is a graph object that represents a social network. It is used to visualize the network using d3.js library. The nodes of the graph are represented by the vertices and the edges are represented by the edges. The nodes are colored based on their color intensity which is calculated using the normalized prior ranks. The links between the nodes are represented by the edges.
- print:<br>
>It is a function in Python that is used to print the output of a statement or expression to the screen. It is a built-in function in Python and does not require any imports. The print function takes an optional argument, which is a string that is printed to the screen. The print function can also be used to print multiple lines of output by separating them
- normalized_prior_ranks:<br>
>The variable normalized_prior_ranks is a dictionary that contains the normalized prior ranks of each node in the graph. The normalized prior ranks are calculated by dividing the prior rank of each node by the sum of all prior ranks in the graph. This normalization is done to ensure that the prior ranks of all nodes are comparable and that the visualization
- open:<br>
>open is a built-in function in Python. It opens a file and returns a file object. It takes two arguments, the name of the file to be opened and the mode in which the file is to be opened. The mode can be either 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending, 'r+' for reading
- str:<br>
>The variable str is a string which is used to store the value of the variable u in the for loop. The variable u is used to iterate through the nodes in the graph and the variable str is used to store the value of the variable u. The variable str is used to create a dictionary entry for each node in the graph. The variable str is also
- data:<br>
>The variable data is a dictionary which contains two keys, one for nodes and other for links. The nodes key contains a list of dictionaries, each of which has an id and color_intensity key. The color_intensity key contains a normalized version of the prior ranks of the nodes. The links key contains a list of dictionaries, each of which has a source and target
- v:<br>
>The variable v is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to make the values of the dictionary more manageable and easier to work with. The role of this variable is to provide a measure of the connectivity of each node in the graph, which can be used to identify nodes that are more central in the network.
- len:<br>
>len is a built-in function in python which returns the length of an object. In this case, it is used to calculate the number of neighbors of each node in the graph. The result is then used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph.
- float:<br>
>float is a data type that represents floating-point numbers. It is used to represent numbers that have a fractional part. For example, 3.14 is a float value.
- degv:<br>
>degv is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative. The square root is used because it is easier to work with than the actual degree. The square root of a number is always positive, so it is a good choice for a value in
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident on that node. The degree of a node is a measure of the connectivity of the node in the graph. The degree of a node is also a measure of the importance of the node in the graph. The degree of a node is used to calculate the centrality of the node in the graph. The degree of a node is also used to calculate the betweenness centrality of the
- list:<br>
>degv is a dictionary that contains the degree of each vertex in the graph.
- pg:<br>
>The variable pg is used to store the PageRank values of each node in the graph. It is a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are the PageRank values. The PageRank algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each node in the graph based on the links between them. The alpha parameter is used to control the damping factor of the algorithm, which determines how much weight is given to the links between nodes. The PageRank values are then used to rank the nodes in the graph based on their importance.
- ppr:<br>
>ppr is a function that takes a training set as input and returns a list of the top 10 most important features in the training set. The function uses a ranking algorithm called "PageRank" to determine the importance of each feature.
