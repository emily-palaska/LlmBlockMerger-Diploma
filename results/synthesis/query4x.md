Query `How do you normalize data?`
## Script Variables
- pg:<br>
>pg is a variable that is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The dataset is split into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split() function is used to split the dataset into two sets, and the pg variable is used to store the result of the split() function.
- measure:<br>
>Measure is a variable that is used to rank the importance of each feature in a dataset. It is a measure of the predictive power of each feature in a dataset. It is used to rank the features based on their importance in predicting the target variable. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the variance of the feature to the variance of the target variable. The higher the value of the measure, the more important the feature is in predicting the target variable. It is used in machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to select the best features
- train:<br>
>It is a list of tuples, each tuple contains a pair of (word, score) where score is the probability of the word being a positive review.
- test:<br>
>It is a variable that contains the test data. It is used to calculate the AUC score. The AUC score is a measure of the accuracy of a model in predicting whether a given data point belongs to the positive class or not. The test data is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array of size (n_samples, n_features) containing the training data. The values of x_train are the features of the training data. The values of y_train are the labels of the training data.
- preprocessing:<br>
>The preprocessing variable is used to normalize the data. It is used to remove the outliers and to make the data more robust. The data is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This helps to reduce the impact of outliers and to make the data more robust. The normalization process is done before the data is used for training the model.
