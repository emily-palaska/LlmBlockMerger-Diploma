## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/plot_lda.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Normal, Ledoit-Wolf and OAS Linear Discriminant Analysis for classification  This example illustrates how the Ledoit-Wolf and Oracle
Approximating Shrinkage (OAS) estimators of covariance can improve classification.  COMMENT: samples for training
```python
n_train = 20
```

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_compare_cross_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Compare cross decomposition methods  Simple usage of various cross decomposition algorithms:  - PLSCanonical - PLSRegression, with
multivariate response, a.k.a. PLS2 - PLSRegression, with univariate response, a.k.a. PLS1 - CCA  Given 2 multivariate covarying two-dimensional
datasets, X, and Y, PLS extracts the 'directions of covariance', i.e. the components of each datasets that explain the most shared variance between
both datasets. This is apparent on the **scatterplot matrix** display: components 1 in dataset X and dataset Y are maximally correlated (points lie
around the first diagonal). This is also true for components 2 in both dataset, however, the correlation across datasets for different components is
weak: the point cloud is very spherical.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
```python
import numpy as np
n = 500
```

### notebooks/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: Predict the value of the digit on the test subset
```python
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```

### notebooks/plot_classification_probability.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Plotting the decision boundaries  For each classifier, we plot the per-class probabilities on the first three columns and the probabilities
of the most likely class on the last column.   COMMENT: colorbar for single class plots
```python
ax_single = fig.add_axes([0.15, 0.01, 0.5, 0.02])
plt.title("Probability")
_ = plt.colorbar(
    cm.ScalarMappable(norm=None, cmap=disp.surface_.cmap),
    cax=ax_single,
    orientation="horizontal",
)
```

### notebooks/plot_classification_probability.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Probabilistic classifiers  We will plot the decision boundaries of several classifiers that have a `predict_proba` method. This will allow
us to visualize the uncertainty of the classifier in regions where it is not certain of its prediction.   COMMENT:
```python
classifiers = {
    "Logistic regression\n(C=0.01)": LogisticRegression(C=0.1),
    "Logistic regression\n(C=1)": LogisticRegression(C=100),
    "Gaussian Process": GaussianProcessClassifier(kernel=1.0 * RBF([1.0, 1.0])),
    "Logistic regression\n(RBF features)": make_pipeline(
        Nystroem(kernel="rbf", gamma=5e-1, n_components=50, random_state=1),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
    "Gradient Boosting": HistGradientBoostingClassifier(),
    "Logistic regression\n(binned features)": make_pipeline(
        KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=5, quantile_method="averaged_inverted_cdf"),
        PolynomialFeatures(interaction_only=True),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
    "Logistic regression\n(spline features)": make_pipeline(
        SplineTransformer(n_knots=5),
        PolynomialFeatures(interaction_only=True),
        LogisticRegression(C=10),
    ),
}
```

### notebooks/plot_classifier_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Classifier comparison  A comparison of several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic datasets. The point of this example is to
illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by these
examples does not necessarily carry over to real datasets.  Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be separated linearly and
the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes and linear SVMs might lead to better generalization than is achieved by other classifiers.  The
plots show training points in solid colors and testing points semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test set.
