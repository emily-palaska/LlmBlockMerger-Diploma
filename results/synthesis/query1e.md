Query: `Create a regression model.`
## Variables:
- model:<br>
>The model is a machine learning model that is used to train a model on the given data. The model takes in the input data and the target data and uses this information to learn a function that maps the input data to the target data. The model is then used to make predictions on new data.
- LogisticRegression:<br>
>LogisticRegression is a classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a given data point belonging to a particular class. It is based on the logistic function, which is a sigmoid function that maps the input data to a probability value between 0 and 1. The output of the logistic function is then used to predict the class of the data point.
- y_train:<br>
>It is a variable that represents the training data. It is a 2D array of size (n,1) where n is the number of training samples. The value of each element in the array is either 0 or 1, representing the class label of the corresponding sample. The variable y_train is used to train the logistic regression model.
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array containing the training data. The data is normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done to ensure that the data is comparable across different datasets and models. The normalization process is also known as standardization or z-score normalization.
- x_test:<br>
>It is a numpy array of shape (1000, 784) containing the test images.
- y_hat:<br>
>It is a variable that is used to store the predicted values of the model. It is a numpy array with the same shape as the input data (x_test). The variable is created using the predict() method of the model object, which takes the input data as an argument and returns the predicted values. The variable is created with the keyword argument probs=True, which indicates that the model should return the predicted probabilities instead of the predicted classes. This is useful when the model is trained with a classification task, but the predicted values are needed for other purposes, such as calculating the
