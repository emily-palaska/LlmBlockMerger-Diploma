Query `Create a regression model.`
## Script Variables
- model:<br>
>The variable model is a logistic regression model that is trained on the training data. The model is used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is trained using the training data and the training labels. The model is then used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels. The model is evaluated using the test labels and the test accuracy is calculated. The model is then used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels
- LogisticRegression:<br>
>LogisticRegression is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification problems. It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a logistic function to map the input data to the output data. The logistic function is a sigmoid function that maps the input data to the probability of the output data. The output data is a binary value (0 or 1) that indicates whether the input data belongs to the positive or negative class. The logistic regression algorithm uses a set of weights and biases to map the input data to the output data. The weights and biases are learned from the training data using
- preprocessing:<br>
>The preprocessing variable is used to normalize the data. It is used to remove the outliers and to make the data more robust. The data is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This helps to reduce the impact of outliers and to make the data more robust. The normalization process is done before the data is used for training the model.
- x_test:<br>
>x_test is a numpy array of shape (10000, 784) containing the test data.
- y_hat:<br>
>The variable y_hat is the predicted probability of the target variable (y) given the input features (x). It is a 2D array with the same shape as the input data (x_test). The first dimension represents the number of samples and the second dimension represents the number of classes. The value of each element in the array is a probability between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood that the corresponding sample belongs to the corresponding class. The model uses the input data (x_test) to calculate the predicted probabilities (y_hat) and then returns them as
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array of size (n_samples, n_features) containing the training data. The values of x_train are the features of the training data. The values of y_train are the labels of the training data.
- y_train:<br>
>It is a list of integers that represents the labels of the training data.
