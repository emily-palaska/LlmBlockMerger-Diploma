## Script Variables
- pg:<br>
>The variable pg is used to store the PageRank values of each node in the graph. It is a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are the PageRank values. The PageRank algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each node in the graph based on the links between them. The alpha parameter is used to control the damping factor of the algorithm, which determines how much weight is given to the links between nodes. The PageRank values are then used to rank the nodes in the graph based on their importance.
- signal:<br>
>The variable signal is a list of integers that represent the signal values.
- group:<br>
>loaded is a variable that stores the loaded dataset.
- graph:<br>
>The graph variable is a networkx graph object. It is used to represent the network of nodes and edges in the dataset. The nodes represent the individuals in the dataset, and the edges represent the connections between them. The graph is used to perform various network analysis tasks, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, or identifying the most important nodes in the network.
