## Script Variables
- pg:<br>
>pg is a variable that is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The dataset is split into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split() function is used to split the dataset into two sets, and the pg variable is used to store the result of the split() function.
- graph:<br>
>The variable graph is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a node in the graph and contains the node's ID and its neighbors. The neighbors are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the ID of the neighbor and the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes.
- signal:<br>
>It is a function that takes a graph and a group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input
- group:<br>
>The variable group is a list of two variables, the first one is a list of nodes and the second one is a list of edges. The nodes are represented as strings and the edges are represented as tuples of two strings. The variable group is used to represent the graph structure of the dataset.
