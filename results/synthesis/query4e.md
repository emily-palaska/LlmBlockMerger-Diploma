### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_compare_cross_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Compare cross decomposition methods  Simple usage of various cross decomposition algorithms:  - PLSCanonical - PLSRegression, with
multivariate response, a.k.a. PLS2 - PLSRegression, with univariate response, a.k.a. PLS1 - CCA  Given 2 multivariate covarying two-dimensional
datasets, X, and Y, PLS extracts the 'directions of covariance', i.e. the components of each datasets that explain the most shared variance between
both datasets. This is apparent on the **scatterplot matrix** display: components 1 in dataset X and dataset Y are maximally correlated (points lie
around the first diagonal). This is also true for components 2 in both dataset, however, the correlation across datasets for different components is
weak: the point cloud is very spherical.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

### notebooks/plot_lda_qda.ipynb
CONTEXT: We generate three datasets. In the first dataset, the two classes share the same covariance matrix, and this covariance matrix has the
specificity of being spherical (isotropic). The second dataset is similar to the first one but does not enforce the covariance to be spherical.
Finally, the third dataset has a non-spherical covariance matrix for each class.   COMMENT:

### notebooks/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: Create a classifier: a support vector classifier
```python
clf = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001)
```

### notebooks/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT: :func:`~sklearn.metrics.classification_report` builds a text report showing the main classification metrics.   COMMENT:
```python
print(
    f"Classification report for classifier {clf}:\n"
    f"{metrics.classification_report(y_test, predicted)}\n"
)
```

### notebooks/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT: If the results from evaluating a classifier are stored in the form of a `confusion matrix <confusion_matrix>` and not in terms of `y_true`
and `y_pred`, one can still build a :func:`~sklearn.metrics.classification_report` as follows:   COMMENT: For each cell in the confusion matrix, add
the corresponding ground truths and predictions to the lists
```python
for gt in range(len(cm)):
    for pred in range(len(cm)):
        y_true += [gt] * cm[gt][pred]
        y_pred += [pred] * cm[gt][pred]
print(
    "Classification report rebuilt from confusion matrix:\n"
    f"{metrics.classification_report(y_true, y_pred)}\n"
)
```

### notebooks/plot_classifier_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Classifier comparison  A comparison of several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic datasets. The point of this example is to
illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by these
examples does not necessarily carry over to real datasets.  Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be separated linearly and
the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes and linear SVMs might lead to better generalization than is achieved by other classifiers.  The
plots show training points in solid colors and testing points semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test set.
COMMENT: Plot the testing points
```python
ax.scatter(
    X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1], c=y_test, cmap=cm_bright, alpha=0.6, edgecolors="k"
)
ax.set_xlim(x_min, x_max)
ax.set_ylim(x_min, y_max)
ax.set_xticks(())
ax.set_yticks(())
