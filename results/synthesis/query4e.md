Query `How do you normalize data?`
## Script Variables
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array of size (n_samples, n_features) containing the training data. The values of x_train are the features of the training data. The values of y_train are the labels of the training data.
- preprocessing:<br>
>The preprocessing variable is used to normalize the data. It is used to remove the outliers and to make the data more robust. The data is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This helps to reduce the impact of outliers and to make the data more robust. The normalization process is done before the data is used for training the model.
- model:<br>
>The variable model is a logistic regression model that is trained on the training data. The model is used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is trained using the training data and the training labels. The model is then used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels. The model is evaluated using the test labels and the test accuracy is calculated. The model is then used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels
- LogisticRegression:<br>
>LogisticRegression is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification problems. It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a logistic function to map the input data to the output data. The logistic function is a sigmoid function that maps the input data to the probability of the output data. The output data is a binary value (0 or 1) that indicates whether the input data belongs to the positive or negative class. The logistic regression algorithm uses a set of weights and biases to map the input data to the output data. The weights and biases are learned from the training data using
- y_train:<br>
>It is a list of integers that represents the labels of the training data.
- p_sum:<br>
>p_sum is a variable that is used to calculate the sum of all the values in the dictionary p. It is used to normalize the prior ranks of the documents in the dictionary normalized_prior_ranks.
- u:<br>
>u is a variable that stores the degree of each node in the graph G. It is calculated by taking the square root of the number of neighbors for each node in the graph. This is done to make the values more manageable and easier to work with in the script. The script uses the built-in function len() to count the number of neighbors for each node and then takes the square root of the result to get the degree of each node. This is done for both the original graph G and the graph G with the degree of each node
- normalized_prior_ranks:<br>
>Normalized prior ranks are the normalized version of the prior ranks. They are used to visualize the prior ranks in the network. The prior ranks are used to determine the importance of each node in the network. The normalized prior ranks are used to determine the relative importance of each node in the network. The normalized prior ranks are used to determine
- p:<br>
>It is a dictionary that contains the prior probabilities of each class.
