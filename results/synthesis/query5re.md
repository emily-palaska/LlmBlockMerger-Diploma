## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Recognizing hand-written digits  This example shows how scikit-learn can be used to recognize images of hand-written digits, from 0-9.

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT: For the purpose of this example, we now define the target `y` such that it is strongly correlated with a direction that has a small variance.
To this end, we will project `X` onto the second component, and add some noise to it.   COMMENT:
```python
pca = pcr.named_steps["pca"]
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_classification_probability.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Plotting the decision boundaries  For each classifier, we plot the per-class probabilities on the first three columns and the probabilities
of the most likely class on the last column.   COMMENT: Ensure legend not cut off
