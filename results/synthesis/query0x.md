## Script Variables
- print:<br>
>The variable print is a function that prints the output of the measure function, which is the rank of the train data set. The measure function is used to calculate the rank of the data set based on the given criteria. The rank is then used to determine the best model for the data set.
- ppr:<br>
>ppr is a variable that is used to rank the data points in the training set. It is a measure of the proximity of a point to the nearest point in the training set. The rank of a point is the number of points in the training set that are closer to it than the point itself. The rank of a point is used to determine the distance between the point and the nearest point in the training set. The rank of a point is also used to determine the distance between the point and the nearest point in the training set. The rank of a
- measure:<br>
>Measure is a variable that is used to rank the importance of each feature in a dataset. It is a measure of the predictive power of each feature in a dataset. It is used to rank the features based on their importance in predicting the target variable. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the variance of the feature to the variance of the target variable. The higher the value of the measure, the more important the feature is in predicting the target variable. It is used in machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to select the best features
- train:<br>
>It is a list of tuples, each tuple contains a pair of (word, score) where score is the probability of the word being a positive review.
- x_train:<br>
>x_train is a numpy array of size (n_samples, n_features) containing the training data. The values of x_train are the features of the training data. The values of y_train are the labels of the training data.
- preprocessing:<br>
>The preprocessing variable is used to normalize the data. It is used to remove the outliers and to make the data more robust. The data is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This helps to reduce the impact of outliers and to make the data more robust. The normalization process is done before the data is used for training the model.
- model:<br>
>The variable model is a logistic regression model that is trained on the training data. The model is used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is trained using the training data and the training labels. The model is then used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels. The model is evaluated using the test labels and the test accuracy is calculated. The model is then used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels
- y_train:<br>
>It is a list of integers that represents the labels of the training data.
