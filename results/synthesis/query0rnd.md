## Script Variables
- ax:<br>
>ax is a scatter plot object that is used to plot the training data points on the scatter plot.
- y_min:<br>
>The variable y_min is the minimum value of the y axis. It is used to set the limits
- x_min:<br>
>x_min is the minimum value of the first column of the dataset X. It is used to determine
- cm_bright:<br>
>cm_bright is a colormap that is used to color the scatter plot. It is a color map
- X_test:<br>
>X_test is a 2D array containing the test data. It is used to plot the scatter
- i:<br>
>The variable i is a counter that is used to keep track of the number of plots that have been
- y_test:<br>
>It is a test dataset used to evaluate the performance of the classifier. It is a binary classification problem

CONTEXT:   Classifier comparison  A comparison of several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic datasets. The point of this example is to
illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by these
examples does not necessarily carry over to real datasets.  Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be separated linearly and
the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes and linear SVMs might lead to better generalization than is achieved by other classifiers.  The
plots show training points in solid colors and testing points semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test set.
COMMENT: Plot the testing points
```python
ax.scatter(
    X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1], c=y_test, cmap=cm_bright, alpha=0.6, edgecolors="k"
)
ax.set_xlim(x_min, y_min)
ax.set_ylim(y_min, y_min)
ax.set_xticks(())
ax.set_yticks(())
i += 1
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
ax.scatter(
    X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1], c=y_test, cmap=cm_bright, alpha=0.6, edgecolors="k"
)
ax.set_xlim(x_min, y_min)
ax.set_ylim(y_min, y_min)
ax.set_xticks(())
ax.set_yticks(())
i += 1
```
