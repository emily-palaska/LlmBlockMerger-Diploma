>Measure is a variable that is used to rank the importance of each feature in a dataset. It is a measure of the predictive power of each feature in a dataset. It is used to rank the features based on their importance in predicting the target variable. It is calculated by taking the ratio of the variance of the feature to the variance of the target variable.
