## Script Variables
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative.
- G:<br>
>The variable G is a graph object that represents the network of interactions between the nodes in the system. It contains information about the edges between the nodes, such as the weight of each edge, the direction of the edge, and any additional properties associated with the edge. The variable G is used to calculate the rank of each node in the network, which is a measure of the importance of each
- len:<br>
>len is a function that returns the length of a sequence. In this case, it is the number of nodes in the graph G. It is used to calculate the mean square error (msq) which is used to determine when the algorithm has converged.
- float:<br>
>float is a data type that represents a floating-point number. It is a decimal number that can be represented with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. The variable float is used to store a floating-point number in the script. It is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph and to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable float is used to store the result of the calculation and is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable
- u:<br>
>u is a variable that stores the degree of each node in the graph G. It is calculated by taking the square root of the number of neighbors for each node in the graph. This is done to make the values more manageable and easier to work with in the script. The script uses the built-in function len() to count the number of neighbors for each node and then takes the square root of the result to get the degree of each node. This is done for both the original graph G and the graph G with the degree of each node
- v:<br>
>v is a variable that is used to store the degree of a node in the graph.
- list:<br>
>degv
- y:<br>
>It is a set of values that are used to train the model. The model is then used to predict values for new data.
- pickle:<br>
>It is a module that is used to serialize and deserialize Python objects. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data
- CustomClassifier:<br>
>CustomClassifier is a class that inherits from sklearn.base.BaseEstimator and sklearn.base.ClassifierMixin. It is used to train a custom classifier on a given dataset and save it to a pickle file. The class has two methods
- custom:<br>
>The variable custom is used to store the trained machine learning model. It is created as an instance of the CustomClassifier class, which is a custom machine learning model that is trained on the given data. If the file path provided exists, the model is loaded from the file. Otherwise, the model is trained and saved to the file. This allows the model to be loaded and used later in the script.
- x:<br>
>The variable x is a 2D numpy array containing the training data for the support vector regression model. The rows of the array correspond to the training examples, and the columns correspond to the features or attributes of each example. The values in the array are the actual values of the features for each training example. The variable y is a 1D numpy array containing the target values for the training data. The values in the array are the actual values of the target variable for each training example. The variable svr is an instance of the support vector regression model, which is used to
- os:<br>
>The os module is a built-in module in Python that provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. It provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. It provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. It provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. It provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. It provides
- path:<br>
>path is a string variable that is used to store the path of the file where the pickle file is to be saved.
