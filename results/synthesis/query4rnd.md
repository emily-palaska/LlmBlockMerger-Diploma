## Script Variables
- model:<br>
>The variable model is a logistic regression model that is trained on the training data. The model is used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is trained using the training data and the training labels. The model is then used to predict the probability of a given observation being a member of a particular class. The model is used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels. The model is evaluated using the test labels and the test accuracy is calculated. The model is then used to make predictions on the test data and the test labels
- LogisticRegression:<br>
>LogisticRegression is a machine learning algorithm that is used for classification problems. It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a logistic function to map the input data to the output data. The logistic function is a sigmoid function that maps the input data to the probability of the output data. The output data is a binary value (0 or 1) that indicates whether the input data belongs to the positive or negative class. The logistic regression algorithm uses a set of weights and biases to map the input data to the output data. The weights and biases are learned from the training data using
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative.
- G:<br>
>The variable G is a graph object that represents the network of interactions between the nodes in the system. It contains information about the edges between the nodes, such as the weight of each edge, the direction of the edge, and any additional properties associated with the edge. The variable G is used to calculate the rank of each node in the network, which is a measure of the importance of each
- len:<br>
>len is a function that returns the length of a sequence. In this case, it is the number of nodes in the graph G. It is used to calculate the mean square error (msq) which is used to determine when the algorithm has converged.
- float:<br>
>float is a data type that represents a floating-point number. It is a decimal number that can be represented with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. The variable float is used to store a floating-point number in the script. It is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph and to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable float is used to store the result of the calculation and is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable
- u:<br>
>u is a variable that stores the degree of each node in the graph G. It is calculated by taking the square root of the number of neighbors for each node in the graph. This is done to make the values more manageable and easier to work with in the script. The script uses the built-in function len() to count the number of neighbors for each node and then takes the square root of the result to get the degree of each node. This is done for both the original graph G and the graph G with the degree of each node
- v:<br>
>v is a variable that is used to store the degree of a node in the graph.
- list:<br>
>degv
- pg:<br>
>pg is a variable that is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The dataset is split into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split() function is used to split the dataset into two sets, and the pg variable is used to store the result of the split() function.
- graph:<br>
>The variable graph is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a node in the graph and contains the node's ID and its neighbors. The neighbors are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the ID of the neighbor and the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes.
- group:<br>
>The variable group is a list of two variables, the first one is a list of nodes and the second one is a list of edges. The nodes are represented as strings and the edges are represented as tuples of two strings. The variable group is used to represent the graph structure of the dataset.
- loaded:<br>
>loaded is a variable that is loaded from a dataset. It is a list of two elements, the first element is a bigraph object and the second element is a group object. The bigraph object contains information about the network, such as the number of nodes and edges, while the group object contains information about the community structure, such as the number of communities and the membership of each node in a community.
- y:<br>
>It is a set of values that are used to train the model. The model is then used to predict values for new data.
- SVR:<br>
>SVR is a support vector regression algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is
- x:<br>
>The variable x is a 2D numpy array containing the training data for the support vector regression model. The rows of the array correspond to the training examples, and the columns correspond to the features or attributes of each example. The values in the array are the actual values of the features for each training example. The variable y is a 1D numpy array containing the target values for the training data. The values in the array are the actual values of the target variable for each training example. The variable svr is an instance of the support vector regression model, which is used to
- algorithm:<br>
>The variable algorithm is a Python script that calculates the heat kernel for a given kernel. The heat kernel is a mathematical function that describes the rate of change of a function with respect to time. In this case, the heat kernel is used to calculate the rate of change of the function with respect to the kernel. The variable algorithm is used to calculate the heat kernel for a given kernel, and is used in many applications such as image processing, signal processing, and machine learning.
- k:<br>
>k is the kernel parameter. It is a parameter that controls the smoothness of the kernel. The higher the value of k, the smoother the kernel will be. The lower the value of k, the more jagged the kernel will be. The default value of k is 1.0.
