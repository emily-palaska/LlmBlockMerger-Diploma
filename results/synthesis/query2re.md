## Script Variables
- pg:<br>
>pg is a variable that is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The dataset is split into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split() function is used to split the dataset into two sets, and the pg variable is used to store the result of the split() function.
- graph:<br>
>The variable graph is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a node in the graph and contains the node's ID and its neighbors. The neighbors are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the ID of the neighbor and the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes.
- signal:<br>
>It is a function that takes a graph and a group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input
- group:<br>
>The variable group is a list of two variables, the first one is a list of nodes and the second one is a list of edges. The nodes are represented as strings and the edges are represented as tuples of two strings. The variable group is used to represent the graph structure of the dataset.
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative.
- G:<br>
>The variable G is a graph object that represents the network of interactions between the nodes in the system. It contains information about the edges between the nodes, such as the weight of each edge, the direction of the edge, and any additional properties associated with the edge. The variable G is used to calculate the rank of each node in the network, which is a measure of the importance of each
- len:<br>
>len is a function that returns the length of a sequence. In this case, it is the number of nodes in the graph G. It is used to calculate the mean square error (msq) which is used to determine when the algorithm has converged.
- float:<br>
>float is a data type that represents a floating-point number. It is a decimal number that can be represented with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. The variable float is used to store a floating-point number in the script. It is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph and to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable float is used to store the result of the calculation and is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable
- u:<br>
>u is a variable that stores the degree of each node in the graph G. It is calculated by taking the square root of the number of neighbors for each node in the graph. This is done to make the values more manageable and easier to work with in the script. The script uses the built-in function len() to count the number of neighbors for each node and then takes the square root of the result to get the degree of each node. This is done for both the original graph G and the graph G with the degree of each node
- v:<br>
>v is a variable that is used to store the degree of a node in the graph.
- list:<br>
>degv
- symm:<br>
>symm is a variable that is used to represent the exponent of the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph
