## Script Variables
- pg:<br>
>pg is a variable that is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The dataset is split into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split() function is used to split the dataset into two sets, and the pg variable is used to store the result of the split() function.
- ppr:<br>
>ppr is a variable that is used to rank the data points in the training set. It is a measure of the proximity of a point to the nearest point in the training set. The rank of a point is the number of points in the training set that are closer to it than the point itself. The rank of a point is used to determine the distance between the point and the nearest point in the training set. The rank of a point is also used to determine the distance between the point and the nearest point in the training set. The rank of a
- signal:<br>
>It is a function that takes a graph and a group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input
- algorithm:<br>
>The variable algorithm is a Python script that calculates the heat kernel for a given kernel. The heat kernel is a mathematical function that describes the rate of change of a function with respect to time. In this case, the heat kernel is used to calculate the rate of change of the function with respect to the kernel. The variable algorithm is used to calculate the heat kernel for a given kernel, and is used in many applications such as image processing, signal processing, and machine learning.
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative.
- G:<br>
>The variable G is a graph object that represents the network of interactions between the nodes in the system. It contains information about the edges between the nodes, such as the weight of each edge, the direction of the edge, and any additional properties associated with the edge. The variable G is used to calculate the rank of each node in the network, which is a measure of the importance of each
- len:<br>
>len is a function that returns the length of a sequence. In this case, it is the number of nodes in the graph G. It is used to calculate the mean square error (msq) which is used to determine when the algorithm has converged.
- float:<br>
>float is a data type that represents a floating-point number. It is a decimal number that can be represented with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. The variable float is used to store a floating-point number in the script. It is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph and to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable float is used to store the result of the calculation and is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable
- u:<br>
>u is a variable that stores the degree of each node in the graph G. It is calculated by taking the square root of the number of neighbors for each node in the graph. This is done to make the values more manageable and easier to work with in the script. The script uses the built-in function len() to count the number of neighbors for each node and then takes the square root of the result to get the degree of each node. This is done for both the original graph G and the graph G with the degree of each node
- v:<br>
>v is a variable that is used to store the degree of a node in the graph.
- list:<br>
>degv
- symm:<br>
>symm is a variable that is used to represent the exponent of the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph. This variable is used to calculate the degree of the graph and is used to calculate the degree of the graph
- preprocessing:<br>
>The preprocessing variable is used to normalize the data. It is used to remove the outliers and to make the data more robust. The data is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This helps to reduce the impact of outliers and to make the data more robust. The normalization process is done before the data is used for training the model.
