CONTEXT:   Recognizing hand-written digits  This example shows how scikit-learn can be used to recognize images of hand-written digits, from 0-9.

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT:  The data  We start by creating a simple dataset with two features. Before we even dive into PCR and PLS, we fit a PCA estimator to display
the two principal components of this dataset, i.e. the two directions that explain the most variance in the data.   COMMENT:
```python
y = X.dot(pca.components_[1]) + rng.normal(size=n_samples) / 2
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 3))
axes[0].scatter(X.dot(pca.components_[0]), y, alpha=0.3)
axes[0].set(xlabel="Projected data onto first pca component", ylabel="y")
axes[1].scatter(X.dot(pca.components_[1]), y, alpha=0.3)
axes[1].set(xlabel="Projected data onto second pca component", ylabel="y")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_classification_probability.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Plotting the decision boundaries  For each classifier, we plot the per-class probabilities on the first three columns and the probabilities
of the most likely class on the last column.   COMMENT: Ensure legend not cut off
```python
mpl.rcParams["savefig.bbox"] = "tight"
fig, axes = plt.subplots(
    nrows=n_classifiers,
    ncols=len(iris.target_names) + 1,
    figsize=(4 * 2.2, n_classifiers * 2.2),
)
evaluation_results = []
levels = 100
for classifier_idx, (name, classifier) in enumerate(classifiers.items()):
    y_pred = classifier.fit(X_train, y_train).predict(X_test)
    y_pred_proba = classifier.predict_proba(X_test)
    accuracy_test = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    roc_auc_test = roc_auc_test(y_test, y_pred_proba, multi_class="ovr")
    log_loss_test = log_loss(y_test, y_pred_proba)
