## Script Variables
- pg:<br>
>pg is a variable that is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The dataset is split into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split() function is used to split the dataset into two sets, and the pg variable is used to store the result of the split() function.
- graph:<br>
>The variable graph is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a node in the graph and contains the node's ID and its neighbors. The neighbors are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the ID of the neighbor and the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes.
- signal:<br>
>It is a function that takes a graph and a group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input and returns a signal object. The signal object contains the signal values for each node in the group, as well as the signal values for each edge in the graph. The signal values are calculated using the pg.to_signal function, which takes the graph and group as input
- group:<br>
>The variable group is a list of two variables, the first one is a list of nodes and the second one is a list of edges. The nodes are represented as strings and the edges are represented as tuples of two strings. The variable group is used to represent the graph structure of the dataset.
- train:<br>
>It is a list of tuples, each tuple contains a pair of (word, score) where score is the probability of the word being a positive review.
- test:<br>
>It is a variable that contains the test data. It is used to calculate the AUC score. The AUC score is a measure of the accuracy of a model in predicting whether a given data point belongs to the positive class or not. The test data is used to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.
- split:<br>
>Split is a variable that is used to separate the dataset into two parts, train and test. The train part is used to train the model and the test part is used to evaluate the model's performance. The split variable is used to split the dataset into two parts, where the first part is used for training and the second part is used for testing. The split variable is used to split the dataset into two parts, where the first part is used for training and the second part is used for testing. The split variable is used to split the dataset into two parts, where the first part
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative.
- G:<br>
>The variable G is a graph object that represents the network of interactions between the nodes in the system. It contains information about the edges between the nodes, such as the weight of each edge, the direction of the edge, and any additional properties associated with the edge. The variable G is used to calculate the rank of each node in the network, which is a measure of the importance of each
- len:<br>
>len is a function that returns the length of a sequence. In this case, it is the number of nodes in the graph G. It is used to calculate the mean square error (msq) which is used to determine when the algorithm has converged.
- float:<br>
>float is a data type that represents a floating-point number. It is a decimal number that can be represented with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. The variable float is used to store a floating-point number in the script. It is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph and to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable float is used to store the result of the calculation and is used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph with the symmetric degree. The variable
- u:<br>
>u is a variable that stores the degree of each node in the graph G. It is calculated by taking the square root of the number of neighbors for each node in the graph. This is done to make the values more manageable and easier to work with in the script. The script uses the built-in function len() to count the number of neighbors for each node and then takes the square root of the result to get the degree of each node. This is done for both the original graph G and the graph G with the degree of each node
- v:<br>
>v is a variable that is used to store the degree of a node in the graph.
- list:<br>
>degv
- pickle:<br>
>It is a module that is used to serialize and deserialize Python objects. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data in a binary format. It is used to store the data
- custom:<br>
>The variable custom is used to store the trained machine learning model. It is created as an instance of the CustomClassifier class, which is a custom machine learning model that is trained on the given data. If the file path provided exists, the model is loaded from the file. Otherwise, the model is trained and saved to the file. This allows the model to be loaded and used later in the script.
- path:<br>
>path is a string variable that is used to store the path of the file where the pickle file is to be saved.
- y:<br>
>It is a set of values that are used to train the model. The model is then used to predict values for new data.
- SVR:<br>
>SVR is a support vector regression algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to predict continuous values. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is
- x:<br>
>The variable x is a 2D numpy array containing the training data for the support vector regression model. The rows of the array correspond to the training examples, and the columns correspond to the features or attributes of each example. The values in the array are the actual values of the features for each training example. The variable y is a 1D numpy array containing the target values for the training data. The values in the array are the actual values of the target variable for each training example. The variable svr is an instance of the support vector regression model, which is used to
