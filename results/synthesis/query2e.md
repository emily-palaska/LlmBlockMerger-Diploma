## Variables:
- pg:<br>
>The variable pg is used to store the PageRank values of each node in the graph. It is a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are the PageRank values. The PageRank algorithm is used to calculate the importance of each node in the graph based on the links between them. The alpha parameter is used to control the damping factor of the algorithm, which determines how much weight is given to the links between nodes. The PageRank values are then used to rank the nodes in the graph based on their importance.
- signal:<br>
>The variable signal is a list of integers that represent the signal values.
- group:<br>
>loaded is a variable that stores the loaded dataset.
- graph:<br>
>The graph variable is a networkx graph object. It is used to represent the network of nodes and edges in the dataset. The nodes represent the individuals in the dataset, and the edges represent the connections between them. The graph is used to perform various network analysis tasks, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, or identifying the most important nodes in the network.
- split:<br>
>The variable split is a tuple that is created by the split() method of the pg module. The split() method takes a string as an argument and returns a tuple containing all the substrings in the string that are separated by the given separator. In this case, the separator is a space, so the split() method returns a tuple containing all the words in the signal string.
- test:<br>
>The variable test is a string that is used to split the signal into two parts, train and test. The variable test is used to store the test set, which is the part of the signal that is used to test the model's performance. The variable test is used to store the test set, which is the part of the signal that is used to test the model's performance. The variable test is used to store the test set, which is the part of the signal that is used to test the model's performance. The variable test is used to store the test set, which is
- train:<br>
>It is a variable that is used to calculate the area under the curve of the ROC curve. The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different thresholds for the classifier. The AUC is a measure of the area under the ROC curve, and it is used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. The train variable is used to calculate the AUC for the test data, which is the data that is used to evaluate the performance of the classifier. The AUC is a measure of the classifier's ability to
- u:<br>
>u is a key in the dictionary p. It is the name of the user.
- v:<br>
>The variable v is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to make the values of the dictionary more manageable and easier to work with. The role of this variable is to provide a measure of the connectivity of each node in the graph, which can be used to identify nodes that are more central in the network.
- len:<br>
>len is a built-in function in python which returns the length of an object. In this case, it is used to calculate the number of neighbors of each node in the graph. The result is then used to calculate the degree of each node in the graph.
- float:<br>
>float is a data type that represents floating-point numbers. It is used to represent numbers that have a fractional part. For example, 3.14 is a float value.
- degv:<br>
>degv is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph G. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident to that node. The value of each key in the dictionary is the square root of the degree of the corresponding node. This is done to ensure that the values in the dictionary are non-negative. The square root is used because it is easier to work with than the actual degree. The square root of a number is always positive, so it is a good choice for a value in
- G:<br>
>G is a graph object that represents a social network. It is used to visualize the network using d3.js library. The nodes of the graph are represented by the vertices and the edges are represented by the edges. The nodes are colored based on their color intensity which is calculated using the normalized prior ranks. The links between the nodes are represented by the edges.
- degu:<br>
>degu is a dictionary that contains the degree of each node in the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are incident on that node. The degree of a node is a measure of the connectivity of the node in the graph. The degree of a node is also a measure of the importance of the node in the graph. The degree of a node is used to calculate the centrality of the node in the graph. The degree of a node is also used to calculate the betweenness centrality of the
- list:<br>
>degv is a dictionary that contains the degree of each vertex in the graph.
- custom:<br>
>The variable custom is a CustomClassifier object. It is used to store the trained model of the custom classifier. If the file path specified in the if statement is a file, then the custom classifier is loaded from the file. Otherwise, a new custom classifier is created and trained using the given training data. The custom classifier is then stored in the file specified by the path variable.
- path:<br>
>The variable path is a string that represents the path to a file on the file system. It is used to load or save data to or from a file. The variable path is a string that represents the path to a file on the file system. It is used to load or save data to or from a file.
- pickle:<br>
>pickle is a module in python which is used to serialize or de-serialize python objects. It is used to save the state of an object in a file. It is a binary format which can be used to save the state of an object in a file. It is a binary format which can be used to save the state of an object in a file. It is a binary format which can be used to save the state of an object in a file. It is a binary format which can be used to save the state of an object in a file. It is
