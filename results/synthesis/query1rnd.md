CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: Predict the value of the digit on the test subset
```python
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```
