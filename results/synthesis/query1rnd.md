- alpha:<br>
>Alpha is a variable that is used to represent the learning rate of the neural network. It is a value between 0 and 1 that determines how quickly the neural network learns from the data. A higher value of alpha means that the neural network will learn faster, but it may also be more prone to overfitting. A lower value of alpha means that the neural network will learn slower, but it may also be less prone to overfitting. The optimal value of alpha depends on the specific problem being solved and the type of neural network being used.
