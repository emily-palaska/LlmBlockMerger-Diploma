## Script Variables
- ax:<br>
>ax is a scatter plot object that is used to plot the training data points on the scatter plot.
- X_train:<br>
>X_train is a matrix of size 500x2 containing the features of the training dataset.
- cm_bright:<br>
>cm_bright is a colormap that is used to color the scatter plot. It is a color map

CONTEXT:   Classifier comparison  A comparison of several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic datasets. The point of this example is to
illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by these
examples does not necessarily carry over to real datasets.  Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be separated linearly and
the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes and linear SVMs might lead to better generalization than is achieved by other classifiers.  The
plots show training points in solid colors and testing points semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test set.
COMMENT: Plot the training points
```python
ax.scatter(
    X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1], c=y_train, cmap=cm_bright, edgecolors="k"
)
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
ax.scatter(
    X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1], c=y_train, cmap=cm_bright, edgecolors="k"
)
```
