```
Consider the following Python script:
x = 0
y = x
print(y)

1. Identify all the variables used in this script.
2. Return the names of the variables as a list, separated by commas.

For example, if the script were:
a = 10
b = a

The variables would be: `a, b`.

Now, for the provided script, what are the variables? Return only the list of variable names, separated by commas.
